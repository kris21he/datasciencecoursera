Type source("run_analysis.R") in RStudio consle to run the script you would see as following:

[1] "reading test data..." 
[1] "reading train data..."
[1] "merging test and train data into one dataset..."
[1] "creating the tidy data and writing to tidydata.txt file..."

#4. Check results
You would also see the tidydata.txt file created under the work directory
Type tidydata<-read.table("tydydata.txt") to view

The data set in tidydata is the final result created according to all the instructions from the assingment

The CodeBook.txt would explain the details for all the column names in tidydata table
